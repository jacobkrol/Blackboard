# Blackboard

This was a webpage created to emulate a photo made in standard Microsoft tools for a redesign project. Contest hosted 
by the University of Illinois at Chicago, February 2019.

**Outcomes:** This was a great practice of HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery, but it was a transitionary piece for me, personally. I have since 
learned the importance of CSS prefixes, flex-box as an alternative to inline-block div's with set sizes, and general HTML formatting 
formalities.
